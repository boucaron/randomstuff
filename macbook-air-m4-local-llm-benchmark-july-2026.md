# Practical Local LLM Performance on a MacBook Air M4 (July 2026)

Tests conducted in July 2026.

This report is not intended to compare model quality or reasoning ability. The goal is to evaluate which GGUF models are practically usable on a MacBook Air M4 with 24 GB of unified memory, focusing on inference speed, memory usage, and overall user experience.

As a reference point, I currently use Gemma 4 26B A4B with a 32K-token context window. During extended sessions, generation typically starts at around 30 tok/s before gradually decreasing toward 20 tok/s due to the combined effects of context growth and thermal throttling.

Because models generate different numbers of tokens, the **later** prompts are sometimes run on a hotter machine than others, and longer generations can induce more thermal throttling.

This is a **practical inference benchmark**, not a synthetic one. The objective is to measure the experience of using these models interactively on a fanless laptop under realistic conditions, including long generations and thermal throttling.

This report focuses on generation throughput. Prompt processing (prefill) was not measured separately.

Note that Apple Silicon uses unified memory shared between CPU and GPU, so the reported memory figures represent total system memory usage rather than dedicated GPU VRAM usage.

## Setup

- MacBook Air M4 24 GB
- macOS Tahoe 26.5.2
- llama.cpp b8833 (later tested with llama-b9940 - no regression)
- prism llama.cpp b9581 (for Prism Bonsai 27B)

## Executive Summary

After testing several recent GGUF models on a MacBook Air M4 (24 GB), I found that:

* **Gemma 4 26B A4B** offers the best overall balance of responsiveness, memory usage, and perceived capability, delivering around 30 tok/s despite its large size.
* **Qwen 3.5 9B** provides the best dense-model balance between speed and capability.
* **Qwen 3 14B** is noticeably slower because all parameters are active during inference.
* **Qwen 3.6 27B** exceeds the practical memory limits of a 24 GB Air and swaps heavily without KV cache quantification reduction.
* **LFM 8B A1B** demonstrates how efficient MoE models can be, sustaining more than 60 tok/s.
* **Prism Bonsai 27B** fits easily in memory, but it is too slow to be usable with about 6 tok/s.
* Quantized KV cache saves 2–3 GB of memory but slightly reduced throughput in these tests.

Reported memory usage refers to total system memory consumption, including background applications such as VS Code, Terminal, Google Chrome (with a few tabs), and Safari.

## Prompts Used

- Prompt 1: I think that the 42 answer is also a sarcastic way to what question matters and the importance of a good question. What do you think
- Prompt 2: Can you enumerate such questions
- Prompt 3: I would say the usage of a llm is a bit like asking such kind of question

**Methodology:** Each model was given the same three prompts with identical inference settings (except where explicitly noted). The reported token count is the number of output tokens actually generated by the model before it stopped naturally. Since different models produce different response lengths—especially reasoning models—the generation time is not directly comparable across models. The primary metric of interest is sustained generation throughput (tokens/second), while the output token counts illustrate how verbose each model is.

# Models

## Gemma 4 26B A4B

**Note:** Gemma 4 26B A4B is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model. Although it contains approximately 26 billion parameters in total, only about 4 billion are active during each token generation, which explains its much higher throughput compared with similarly sized dense models.

I was curious to try a tiny model like this one. 

*NB*: Of course, it is extremely limited and It produces mostly nonsensical answers. It is not built for that.

It is extremely fast, although its capabilities are understandably limited.

## LFM 2.5 1.2B Instruct

I was even more curious to try a small model after testing the tiny one.

*NB*: Clearly it has limitations and this is not its main purpose.

### Observations

The 1.2B model is around half the speed of the 230M version but remains extremely fast at ~87 t/s.

This shows the interesting trade-off of small models: adding parameters quickly reduces throughput, but can significantly improve instruction following and usefulness.

Compared with larger local assistants, these models are not competing on deep reasoning capability, but they offer near-instant responses and very low resource usage.

## LFM 2.5 8B A1B

What does this model offer?

Prompt 2: Output 1 193 tokens 19s 61.75 t/s

Prompt 3: Output 929 tokens 15s 61.59 t/s

### Observations

This is a reasoning-only model.

Despite being an 8B total parameter model, the MoE architecture keeps inference extremely fast on Apple Silicon.

At around 62 t/s while generating reasoning tokens, it demonstrates a very different trade-off compared with dense models.

The model is not intended to replace larger reasoning models, but it offers an interesting middle ground:

- much faster than dense 9B–14B models
- more capable than tiny edge models
- reasoning enabled by design

## Prism Bonsai 27B

I am curious about this one, it claims to retain the majority of the dense Qwen 3.6 27B while using very aggressive compression.

```bash

--temp 0.7 \
--top-p 0.95 \
--top-k 20 \
-ngl 99 \
-fa on \
--cache-type-k q4_0 \
--cache-type-v q4_0 \
-np 1 \
--port 8080
```

Prompt 1: Output 1523 tokens 10.13 t/s - run 1

Prompt 2: Output 2341 tokens 8.04 t/s - run 1

Prompt 3: Output 2449 tokens 3.81 t/s - run 1


Prompt 1: Output 1799 tokens 9.43 t/s - run 2

Prompt 2: Output 1978 tokens 6.87 t/s - run 2

Prompt 3: Output 2242 tokens 6.32 t/s - run 2

Memory usage is slightly lower about 18.77 GB to 19.47GB at the end of the last prompt, which is pretty good.

The token per seconds is getting slightly lower at the end of run 1, for sure thermal throttling, but may be something else. No swapping, nothing like that. Retried a second time.

I would say it is not really usable, may be on a Pro or Max model thanks to the additional  memory bandwidth. It fits without any issue, there is enough room to put large context too. Still, this is really interesting because if there are MOE variants.

# Sustained Performance

The MacBook Air is fanless, so sustained workloads behave differently from actively cooled systems:

* Initial throughput around 30 tok/s
* Drops to roughly 20 tok/s during long generations
* Fanless chassis eventually throttles
* Short chats remain very responsive

# Conclusions

* Gemma 4 26B A4B provided the best overall balance of responsiveness, memory usage, and perceived capability in these tests.
* Qwen 3 14B offers stronger dense-model behavior but at roughly one-third the throughput.
* Qwen 3.6 27B exceeds the practical memory limits of this machine and triggers swapping.
* Qwen 3.5 9B provides an excellent balance between capability and speed.
* LFM 8B A1B demonstrates how efficient Mixture-of-Experts models can be on Apple Silicon.
* Prism Bonsai 27TB fits well in the memory but the memory bandwidth requirement make it not useful in practice with about 6 tok/s.
* KV cache quantization reduces memory usage by 2–3 GB but decreases throughput in these tests.
* The fanless MacBook Air remains highly capable for local inference, although sustained workloads eventually trigger thermal throttling.

These results should be viewed as practical guidance rather than absolute rankings, since model capabilities, quantization formats, inference engines, and future llama.cpp optimizations will continue to evolve.

## ChangeLog

17/07/2026:

* Update flags to reduce number of parallel sequences to decode (-np 1)
* Add Prism Bonsai 27B
