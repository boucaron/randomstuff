Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max Tegmark

First Impression: The Introduction is really superb, I loved it. I hope the following chapters will be like that.


So far, I read most of the book. Actually, the remaining of the book is not as good.
It is easy to read and accessible.
There are a lot of explicit and implement references to the book of Nick Bostrom, I do not see as something 'bad', but I can understand the reaction of some readers.
There is some 'unbalance' in the book.
The interesting part comes from the background of the author.
He provides another point of view with respect to the cosmology 'scale', I think it is where there are interesting and additional contributions.

I am not so 'enthusiastic' with respect to points of view of the author.
Is it worth reading, yes I recommend it definitively, before reading Nick Bostrom's book.
