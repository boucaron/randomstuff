Modern architecture and urban planning have become a complete absurdity when it comes to creating sustainable and energy-efficient living spaces, as well as promoting business growth.

# Separation concept

The concept of 'separation' is a fundamental pillar of modern architecture and urban planning. It involves dividing spaces into zones for working, sleeping, shopping, entertainment, and so on, which requires people to move from one zone to another, wasting valuable time that could be used for more productive activities. By designing buildings with only one purpose, you limit the potential for interaction and collaboration between people and businesses. Job roles and activities evolve over time, making it difficult to plan for the future. The key is not to focus on specific activities, but rather to simplify the setup, installation, and interaction of the space to enhance its versatility and adaptability.

# Business 'centric'

The focus on business in modern architecture also means that many buildings are grossly underutilized. Take office buildings, for instance. They are only used during the week, leaving the spaces deserted and lifeless during evenings and weekends. It's a waste of valuable resources to have structures that serve a single purpose for such a small portion of time.

## Restaurant case in Office Zone
Imagine a scenario where a restaurant is located in an office zone. During lunchtime, the restaurant may have decent business, but it will likely be a ghost town in the evenings and on weekends unless it's a trendy spot. If you want to generate consistent revenue and attract a higher-spending clientele, you need a densely populated urban area with lots of customers, particularly during the evenings and weekends.

## Shopping case
Let's consider the scenario of a shopping district in one of these segregated zones. Most of these zones are designed for people to come by car, leading to a deserted atmosphere for most of the week, with only a surge of people on Saturdays. However, the new generation of customers are no longer willing to spend hours driving to a shop, only to find limited services and expertise. They either prefer to use online shopping platforms like Amazon or go to specialized shops that provide personalized service for a higher price. The problem here is that due to the lack of locality, these shops cannot capture more traffic and grow their business. What is needed is a densely inhabited urban area with a high volume of customers who can provide consistent revenue throughout the week. This is the same case with restaurants - without a dense population nearby, it is difficult to capture more business and increase revenues.


## Issues

### Separation concept

Inefficiency and time wastage: separating different functions into distinct zones can lead to inefficiencies and wastage of time. Moving from one zone to another can be time-consuming, especially in larger urban areas. This can result in reduced productivity and a less efficient use of resources.

Limited interactivity: By separating different functions into distinct zones, there is a risk of limiting the amount of interaction and collaboration that can occur between people and businesses. For example, having a mixed-use development that combines residential, commercial, and entertainment functions in one building can create more opportunities for people to interact and collaborate.

Lack of flexibility: The Separation concept can make it difficult to adapt to changes in activities and jobs over time. As the needs of a community change, it may become necessary to rezone certain areas or change the mix of functions within a building. This can be difficult to achieve if the Separation concept is rigidly applied.

Homogeneity: Separating functions into distinct zones can result in a lack of diversity and homogeneity in urban areas. For example, if all residential areas are located in one zone, it can lead to a lack of diversity in terms of housing options, lifestyles, and socio-economic backgrounds.

Overemphasis on physical design: The Separation concept can sometimes overemphasize the physical design of urban areas and buildings at the expense of other important considerations, such as social equity, environmental sustainability, and economic development.

### Business centric

Limited use: Focusing on business-centric development can lead to underused buildings and areas outside of business hours. This can result in inefficient use of resources and reduced livability of the area for residents.

Lack of diversity: Overemphasizing businesses can result in a lack of diversity in urban areas. It may lead to an overabundance of similar businesses, such as office buildings or shopping centers, and a lack of other important amenities, such as parks, public spaces, and cultural institutions.

Unsustainability: Business-centric development can be unsustainable in terms of transportation and energy usage. For example, if a shopping center is designed primarily for car access, it can lead to increased traffic and air pollution.

Overemphasis on profit: Focusing primarily on business can sometimes overemphasize profit over other important considerations, such as social equity, environmental sustainability, and cultural diversity.

Lack of adaptability: A business-centric approach can sometimes result in a lack of adaptability to changing economic conditions or community needs. For example, if a shopping center is built with a specific mix of stores, it may be difficult to adjust to changing consumer preferences or economic conditions.


# Honest design

The concept of "honest design" in modern architecture refers to a design approach that is true to the materials and construction methods used. It emphasizes the use of materials and structural elements in their raw and natural form, without the need for excessive ornamentation or decoration.

In this approach, buildings are designed with a focus on their function and purpose, rather than solely for aesthetic purposes. The design is stripped down to its most essential elements, with the aim of creating a sense of simplicity, clarity, and order.

Honest design also promotes the use of sustainable materials and construction methods, with a focus on minimizing waste and reducing the environmental impact of buildings.

Overall, the goal of honest design is to create buildings that are not only functional and efficient, but also visually appealing in their own right. By emphasizing the beauty of materials and structural elements, architects can create buildings that are timeless and enduring, rather than just trendy or fashionable.




## Beauty matters

Beauty is a universal concept that resonates with everyone. It has the power to speak to us, inspire us, and move us in a way that nothing else can. Even the most perfectly functional building, designed with pure efficiency in mind, will fall flat if it lacks beauty. This is because humans are not purely rational beings - we are emotional and intuitive, and we respond to beauty on a deep level. Beauty in architecture can take many forms, from intricate ornamentation to striking shapes and bold colors. There is nothing wrong with incorporating these elements into buildings, and in fact, they can provide a sense of context and connection to the natural world that we all crave. Beauty can also play a role in creating a sense of pride and ownership in a community, as people are more likely to care for and maintain buildings that they find visually appealing. Even in cases where cost is a concern, it is important to strive for beauty in architecture, as it is ultimately an investment in the well-being and happiness of the people who will use and inhabit the building.

## Nature matters

Nature plays an essential role in our lives, not only for its beauty but also for its benefits to our health and well-being. The connection to nature is an important aspect of creating livable and sustainable cities. Green spaces and natural environments help to reduce stress, promote physical activity, and provide a sense of community. When it comes to architecture and urban planning, incorporating nature into the design is crucial. Buildings that are surrounded by greenery or have a scenic view can enhance the quality of life for the people who live and work in them. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about creating a healthy and sustainable environment. In contrast, an overabundance of concrete and other artificial materials can have a negative impact on both the environment and the people who inhabit the space. Concrete structures absorb and reflect heat, contributing to the urban heat island effect, while a lack of greenery can lead to poor air quality and increased pollution. Therefore, it's essential to consider nature in any architectural or urban design project. By incorporating green spaces, natural elements, and sustainable practices, we can create healthier and more sustainable cities that are better suited to the needs of the people who inhabit them.


Sticking only to function and purpose without considering aesthetics and beauty can result in unappealing designs. The concept of "form follows function" in architecture and design is important, but it doesn't mean that function should be the only consideration. Aesthetics and beauty can enhance function by making a design more appealing and enjoyable to use.

In fact, nature is a great example of this. Organic shapes and structures often have evolved to optimize function, but they also have a natural beauty and aesthetic appeal. This is because nature is not solely concerned with function, but also with efficiency, sustainability, and beauty. Organic shapes are often more efficient at distributing stress and load, making them structurally strong and stable, but they are also often visually appealing and beautiful.

In summary, a design that considers both function and aesthetics can result in a more appealing and efficient design, and nature is a great example of how form and function can work together to create beautiful and efficient structures.

# Sustainability 
## Modern Materials 

The use of steel, concrete, and large glass windows is a common feature in modern architecture, which allows for the creation of spacious and open buildings with thin walls. However, these materials are finite resources, and the production of concrete requires the use of scarce river sand. Moreover, the use of large glass windows contributes to poor energy efficiency, and even the most efficient triple-glazing can be as ineffective as a concrete wall without insulation.

## Long run

In the long term, it's not sustainable to have buildings that become obsolete after just a few decades and end up being demolished. Instead, we should focus on constructing beautiful, efficient, and maintainable buildings that can last for centuries and are 
easy to repurpose or reuse. This is why it's crucial not to tie a building to a specific activity.

## Modular building

Modularity is a key aspect of sustainable building design, as it allows for greater adaptability and flexibility in the use of a building over time. By designing buildings with modular components that can be easily assembled, disassembled, and reconfigured, the same structure can be used for multiple purposes throughout its lifespan. This reduces the need for new construction and demolition, which saves resources and minimizes waste. In addition, modular building design can facilitate more efficient use of space, as areas can be easily repurposed or combined as needed. Overall, modularity is a powerful tool for creating buildings that are adaptable to changing needs and can be used for many years to come.


## Maintenable and Upgradable building

A building that is designed to be maintainable and upgradable is essential for ensuring long-term sustainability, efficiency, and adaptability to changing needs.

A maintainable building is one that is constructed with the ability to efficiently modify or repair its systems and components over time, without the need for extensive renovations or demolitions. Key systems such as electrical, cooling, heating, network, and plumbing should be easily accessible, enabling straightforward maintenance and repairs. This reduces both the overall cost and the time required for upkeep, ensuring the building can remain functional and efficient in the long term.

The significance of maintainability becomes particularly apparent in crucial building systems such as electrical, cooling, heating, network, and plumbing. These systems play a vital role in the building's functionality and require consistent care to avoid disruptions.


For example, let's consider a situation where a water leak occurs in a bathroom. The leak originates behind a tiled wall that is not easily accessible. As a result, the water seeps down to the floor below and damages the ceiling. Detecting the leak becomes challenging, and by the time it's discovered, significant damage has already occurred, necessitating costly repairs amounting to several thousands of dollars.

However, had the pipe been designed to be more accessible, the water leak could have been detected much earlier and resolved with ease. A simple and prompt fix, without the need for sophisticated tools like thermal cameras, would have involved accessing the pipe, fixing the issue, and then making the necessary repairs to the tiles and ceiling. This alternative approach would have cost only a few hundred dollars, significantly less than the extensive repairs required when the pipe is not readily accessible.


A maintainable building ensures that these systems are easy to access and repair, without the need to demolish existing walls or components. This reduces the overall cost and time required for maintenance and repairs, and helps to ensure that the building can remain functional and efficient over the long term.


 In light of rapid technological advancements, it becomes crucial for buildings to be upgradable. For example, the integration of proper insulation significantly reduces heating and cooling demands.Therefore, building design should incorporate the flexibility to accommodate future upgrades, such as enhancing insulation capabilities.

Some might argue that designing a maintainable and upgradable building may appear oversized and costly initially. However, taking a short-term cost-saving approach might lead to severe consequences in the future. If there is no allowance for improvement and expansion, it could necessitate demolishing the entire structure, leading to a significant waste of resources and energy. Thus, considering the long-term benefits, it is wise to slightly oversize the building or plan for future extensions.
