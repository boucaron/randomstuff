A Win Without Pitching Manifestor by Blair Enns

This is a short book with a concise and direct writting.
It is worth reading if you want to differentiate yourself and not be a commodity on the market.
Pitching: given your ideas for free.
You need to reverse that and become the expert being called who can charge some money. 
The point is to shift the power back from the client towards you.

# Collaboration
No presentation, seek conversation and collaboration.
 Practitioners do not present. Stars do not audition.
 
Challenge diagnosed and the strategy prescribed and agreed to by the customer.
Continuous check against the strategy
Freedom of execution: invite the client for "That blue isn't bold enough to deliver on our core value of strength" BUT we explain that he is not invited to say "Make it darker". 
Fewers Options of Better Quality --> goes back to the strategy
Only We Present Our Work -> anything presented to anyone in our client companies, it is personnel from the firm that does so. Our work does not get presented without our involvement.

Conversation used to determine is both parties would be well served by working rogether. Conversation lowers buying resistance with resp. to Presentation.

Objective: Determine Fit. Our mission is to position, our objective is to determine a fit.

We must never allow ourselves to be placed in the presenter/complier role where the terms and next steps of the relationship are dictated to us. Assuming this role, we will never be able to exchange to the expert practitioner role required for us to do our best work.

# Diagnose Before Prescribing

- Diagnose the problem
- Prescribe 
- Apply
- Reapply if necessary

The customer is not always right. He usually has strong ideas and a strong sense that he is right, but is locked into a narrow view and weighted down by constraints that seem to him to be more immutable than they really are. Our reaction must, "You may be correct, but let's find out for sure".

Practitioner's Perspective

Ability to see problem differently, and finding solutions others cannot see.
Design is not solution it is the process. We cannot be effective, responsible designers if we allow the client to impose his process or truncation/marginalize ours.

## The Nature of Successful Clients

They want to keep control even it is not in their best interest, it is in their nature (fable of 'The Frog and the Scorpion')

## The Root of Bad Engagements

Walk away from demanding and difficult client where is the process is dictated to us, or where we are asked to propose solutions without a proper diagnosis.

## Polite Battle for Control

Bring our own methodology to the engagement. 
No diagnostic -> malpractice. Walk away from those that would have us proceed based on guesses or un-validated self-diagnoses.

# What it Means to Sell

We cannot be in business without embracing selling.
Selling when done properly has nothing to do with persuading. 
Selling is about determining a fit between the buyer's need and the seller's supply, and then facilitating a next step. 
We do not sell toasters. We sell ideas and advices (our heads), and the how we sell matters, we cannot disappears. Being a respectful facilitator.

## New Model of Selling

To sell it to:
- Help the unaware
- Inspire the interested
- Reassure those who have formed intent


The client evolves, from unaware of his problem/opportunity, to being interested, to intent on acting on it. As he progresses our role must change from helping, inspiring and reassuring.

### Help the Unaware

We are experts we should be able to describe who we help and how.
If the client says he does not see a fit, we need more time with him because we did not manage to capture and to communicate it succinctly
Do not push for the next meeting, take the long road and help to see if he does have a problem.

Our role of though leadership is to educate, not to persuade. 
We continue to cement our position as leaders in our field through writing: Experts write.
It takes patience.


### Inspiring the Interested

In some way the unaware future client sits on his desk reading our though leadership, his awareness grows and he begins to assess his situation, he begins to gather more information. He is interested but not yet intent on taking action. The client looks for inspiration to move forward. The goal is to inspire him to form the intent to solve his problem. Focus is on the client to facilitate the change in himself. Inspire by our best work, this is the primary role of our website.

Careful: trying to inspire someone who does not recognize the problem is a recipe for defensiveness and resentment. Inspiration is kept for the Interested.

### Reassuring the Intent

The customer says 'This is fantastic, this is what we need'.
Actually this is not the last step, after there is the doubt. He considers all the things that could go wrong. This is not the time to play our strengths, we should reassure. He asks questions of the smallest details, in needs assurance that is not doing a mistake. Phased engagements, pilot projects, money-back guarantees, case studies frames in defined methodologies. 

The key is to respond to the motivation and not necessarily the request.
