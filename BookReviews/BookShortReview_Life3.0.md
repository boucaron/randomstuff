The introduction of Max Tegmark's 'Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence' is superb and engaging.
However, I found some of the remaining chapters less interesting. While the book is easy to read and accessible, there are many references to Nick Bostrom's work, which may not appeal to all readers.
In my opinion, the book is unbalanced, and some topics are more compelling than others.
Nonetheless, Tegmark's background in cosmology offers a unique perspective and some valuable insights.
However, I was disappointed with the ending of the book, which had too many layers of speculation piled on top of each other or only scratching the surface. 
While I disagree with some of his viewpoints, I recommend reading the book before diving into Bostrom's work.
