The Myth of Artificial Intelligence: Why Computers Can’t Think the Way We Do by Erik J. Larson


Keep it short: I strongly recommend this book. Probably to be read after Nick Bostrom's SuperIntelligence.
The book was published in 2021, which is important to note because Bostrom's book is now somewhat outdated.

I believe that this book is an excellent resource for understanding the limitations of Artificial Intelligence. It provides a historical and contextual perspective on important failures in the field, which sheds light on the challenges that AI faces.

One of the things that I appreciate about this book is its discussion of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. These theorems are essential for understanding the hard limits of mathematics, computer science, and formal systems in general. The book does an excellent job of explaining how, even in a consistent system, there are things that you cannot prove within the system itself. This includes undecidable statements, which are linked to Turing machines and other related topics. While this material is introductory, I still find it fascinating and informative.

The author also explores classic topics such as the use and potential abuses of modus-ponens and the flaws in induction in statistics. For example, specific events may not exist in the data, which is known as the long-tail problem.

However, the main argument of the book is that deductive and inductive inference are not enough for achieving human-level intelligence. The book talks about the concept of abductive inference, which involves the ability to come up with intuitions and hypotheses that are better than random guesses at the truth. Humans often use this approach when they have experience or common sense to draw upon, or when there is a scarcity or lack of data. Unfortunately, existing AI systems struggle with abductive inference, which highlights a key limitation of current technology.

The book also discusses the lack of innovation in AI and related topics. It highlights the common misconception that "big data" alone will generate new intelligence, when in fact this is not the case. While I found some of the later arguments in the book to be a bit repetitive, overall I still consider it to be a valuable read.
