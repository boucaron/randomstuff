# The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff

This book is truly excellent if you want to understand how Google and Facebook managed to grow so rapidly. Surveillance Capitalism is a new form of capitalism centered around gathering as much data as possible on people, to be sold as 'futures' for advertisements and more. Of course, with such knowledge, it becomes easy to manipulate individuals based on this vast amount of information. Consider the customization of the data and news you access; it poses a risk to democracy. This data is referred to as 'behavioral surplus,' and manipulating people on a large scale has never been easier.

A significant issue arises concerning reciprocity in comparison to regular capitalism—typically, when you buy something, you get something in return. The core questions are: who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides? Privacy is a major concern; Surveillance Capitalists know too much and are continually seeking new ways to gather data and enhance their knowledge.

For example, consider Google Android—it's not merely a competitor to Apple iPhone but a tool to gather more data on a broader population. Even though Android is supposed to be 'open source,' if a phone builder attempts to remove Google tools used for data gathering, Google will retaliate and block basic features of the phone.

Another instance is an insurance company for your car offering a small amount of money if you install a monitoring device. The goal is to improve the insurance company's profitability, not yours. Even if you receive a small reward initially, reciprocity is non-existent. The long-term goal of the insurance company is to pressure automotive manufacturers and governments, using the 'safety' umbrella, to force all drivers to adopt this system, while gathering and selling their data for various purposes.

In a different scenario, when you buy a Samsung 'connected' washing machine, you have to install an application that gathers your identity, images, agenda, and additional personal data, just to update the software or perform basic customization. Reciprocity in this context is absent. Users are compelled to provide data with false statements, even blocking basic functionality of the hardware unrelated to personal data.

Moreover, a myriad of interconnected data sets further amplifies knowledge about individuals, leaving them unaware of the scope or accessibility of this information.

While the book may be too lengthy for my taste and contains repetitions, the content is undeniably excellent.
