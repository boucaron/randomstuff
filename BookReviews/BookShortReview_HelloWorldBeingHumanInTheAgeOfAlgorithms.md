Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms by Hannah Fry

At first, I was kind of bit bored by the introduction, but I continue and actually it is a pretty good book and well written about Artifical Intelligence and a good overview of its usage of today (pre ChatGPT era) and more interestingly about the issues in the control/decision process. I would say all the outliers and the exceptions, the critical cases that are for the most part not handled and not understood by most of the persons, this is extremely important to understand the limits of such approach. 
It is well written, easy to read and well explained. It is a good read still worth to do.
