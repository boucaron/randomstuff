SuperFounders by Ali Tamaseb

After examining the existing reviews of this book, it's clear that some are quite unkind, to say the least. Personally, I wouldn't recommend reading it, not necessarily due to other reviews, but because I don't believe it offers enough interesting material to justify the time spent reading it. While statistics can be intriguing, it's crucial to take them with a grain of salt. Success cannot be inferred based solely on metrics. There are numerous parameters to consider, such as the people involved, the market, the product, and the service. In most cases, luck plays a tremendous role in aligning all the gears. Given the failure rate of startups, which is slightly higher than 99%, it doesn't make much sense to draw conclusions based on the remaining companies.

Here's a quick summary of what I found interesting:

- There's no good or bad time to start a company, but you need to have the right idea, team, and implementation at the right time.
- If you've tried more than once and failed, there's a higher chance of success, but it doesn't mean repeating the same mistakes.
- Execution and speed are key to optimizing time to market, especially for tech companies, which can benefit from a "First Mover Advantage." Some people talk about the "Last Mover Advantage," using Google as an example, but I disagree; Google is a "First Mover Advantage" from a tech standpoint. Additionally, if you've already taken most of the market and the cost of entry is high, it will limit your competition.
- An obsession with quality, or anything else that matters to what you're doing, is crucial.
- Starting from a niche and generating a slightly bigger and new market could result in becoming a "Unicorn."
