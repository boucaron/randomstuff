Hackers and Painters by Paul Graham

It is still worth to read it today, even it is 'old'

To keep it short, what I think is important:
- Small is beautiful, a small effective team matters to be slightly above the **average**
- Speed of execution is important and having tools to implement this, hack spirit
- Redesign is fundamental, you are confronted to the users and to the ever changing specification
- Programming Language is not about the language or the expressivity, it is the ecosystem (tools, libraries...) and the community. For instance if you are interested in AI, it does not make sense to work in Scala or whatever, when all the libraries and the frameworks are mostly implemented in Python (even if C/CPP can be useful too)
