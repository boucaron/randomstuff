# Deep Work by Cal Newport

Introduction: Deep Work is a highly recommended book by Cal Newport. In my personal opinion, it is definitely worth reading. It shares a similar essence with the book 'The Power of Habit,' which adds to its appeal.

Summary: Deep Work focuses on methods to engage in deep and intense work with utmost concentration, significance, and intensity. It delves into various ways to train yourself and enhance your endurance for such deep work, thereby helping you avoid shallow and uninteresting tasks as well as distractions. For me, it is somehow related to the 'distraction'/'le divertissement' by Blaise Pascal.
