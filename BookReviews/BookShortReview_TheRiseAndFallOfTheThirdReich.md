The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany by William L. Shirer

This is not a review.
It is a long and dense. Despite its length and the difficulty of the subject, it is pretty well written, concise (yes it is) and clear. The chronology, the succession of events and the gradation provide a deeper insight.  It is more than just an history book, it is an experience.
