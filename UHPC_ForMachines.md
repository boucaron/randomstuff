# Ultra High Performance Concrete for Machines Chassis


Recently, I came across the concept of Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC), thanks to publications by Prof. Sherif El-Tawil (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eltawil/uhpc.html). UHPC, particularly when reinforced with Steel Fibers, offers impressive strength, durability, and promising mechanical properties for various applications.

When considering materials for the construction of custom CNC machines or 3D printers, two uncommon choices are Beton and Epoxy Concrete, known for their favorable stiffness and damping properties during machining. Casting is the preferred fabrication method due to its advantages in creating complex geometries and ensuring accurate, distortion-free parts, which simplifies assembly.

While Epoxy Concrete possesses desirable properties, it can be quite expensive. On the other hand, the Beton approach appears promising, but concerns arise regarding its damping capabilities and structural strength.

For the optimal combination of stiffness and damping properties, essential for achieving high-quality machining with minimal vibrations and faster processing, Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) presents itself as a potential solution. However, it is essential to further investigate and confirm UHPC's specific damping characteristics before considering it as the material of choice.

Using Granit precision plates and bars is an alternative for precision machines, but it may exceed the budget and lacks the flexibility to create complex shapes without additional machining.

Therefore, in the pursuit of a chassis that offers both rigidity and affordability without compromising on quality, thorough testing and analysis of UHPC's damping properties would be required to determine its suitability for CNC machines and 3D printers.



One source (https://hiperfibersolutions.com/uhpc/) provides an "open recipe" for UHPC, which serves as a starting point for experimentation. The recipe consists of the following components:

- 653 lbs: Portland Cement
- 653 lbs: Slag/GBS Cement
- 394 to 398 lbs: Silica Sand (80 to 200 microns)
- 1577 to 1590 lbs: Silica Sand (400 to 800 microns)
- 327 lbs: Silica Fume
- 264 to 276 lbs: Water
- 20 to 39 lbs: High-range water reducer
- 265 lbs: Steel Fibers (2% by volume)
The use of Steel Fibers in the mix enhances the concrete's overall performance, contributing to its robustness and reliability.

It is worth noting that the UHPC recipe provided above serves as a starting point, and further adjustments and testing may be necessary to fine-tune the concrete mix for specific applications. Nevertheless, UHPC shows great promise and offers exciting possibilities for various engineering and construction projects.



The primary challenge lies in sourcing the core components required for the UHPC mix at a fair price:

1. **Steel Fibers**: Obtaining the ideal steel fibers with specifications of 0.3 to 0.4 mm in diameter, 10 to 15 mm in length, and twisted configuration proves difficult for small batches. Finding a supplier willing to provide this specific type of steel fiber in relatively small quantities can be a hurdle.

2. **GBS (Granulated Blastfurnace Slag) / Slag Cement**: This component, essential for UHPC mix, is typically not readily available for purchase by individuals and is mostly imported. Accessing it for small-scale projects can pose challenges.

3. **Silica Fumes (Fly Ashes)**: Although sourcing silica fumes in small quantities may be relatively easier, ensuring the right class (Class C instead of Class F) for the UHPC mix can be a concern.

On a positive note, securing an ample amount of suitable sand is not problematic.

Regarding the damping properties, there have been publications suggesting the addition of Polypropylene Fibers to enhance the damping characteristics of the UHPC. This could potentially lead to a UHPC mix that exhibits damping properties comparable to Epoxy Concrete, but at a fraction of the cost, while also offering superior stiffness and durability.

Despite the challenges in sourcing some core components, with the right modifications and material adjustments, achieving a cost-effective UHPC mix with improved damping and overall performance seems feasible. This development opens up the opportunity to create high-performance structures comparable to Epoxy Concrete but with significant cost savings.
